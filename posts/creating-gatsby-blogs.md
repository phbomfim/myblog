## How to create a simple blog with Gatsby

- I created a new gatsby blog with Gatsby library
- I used the [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) to create a simple blog.
- And I did the tutorial from Gatsby website : [Making a site with user authentication](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/authentication-tutorial/).


## Gatsby Blog with admin area and publish

- [Make a Gatsby Blog with Netfly CMS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/blog-netlify-cms-tutorial/): The gatsby tutorial.
- By the tutorial I created a git repositoy associating with Netfly.
- I logged in Netfly with my Github account.
